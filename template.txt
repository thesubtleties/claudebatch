I need a beginner's guide to {title} for my bootcamp graduates. This will be shared as part of a learning resource collection on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Python SDK. 

The content should include:
- Clear explanations of concepts
- Practical code examples using Python 3.10+
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Comparisons to familiar web development concepts when possible
- Step-by-step instructions for implementation

My students have completed a coding bootcamp, so they understand basic programming concepts but are new to working with AI tools and integrations. The tone should be educational, friendly, and accessible.

Additional context: {description}
